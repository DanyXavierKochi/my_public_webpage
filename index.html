      today as a living testimony of God’s grace and the loving intercession of St. Antony,

    <p>
      The Kannamaly St. Joseph Nercha Sadya, observed since 1905, commemorates a miraculous
      healing from a cholera outbreak. Held annually on 19th March, the feast remains a powerful
      expression of faith, gratitude, and communal devotion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph of Kannamaly, brought from Spain in 1905, is a treasured
      sign of God’s grace, drawing countless devotees who seek his powerful intercession.
    </p>

  <!-- HISTORY -->
  <div id="history">
    <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

    <p>
      St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 281 years.
      The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church site,
      under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Church was destroyed by sea erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was
      constructed in 1796. In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish
      and declared an independent parish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Severe sea erosions in 1905 and 1908 caused partial damage and complete ruin of the Church.
      On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid at the present site.
    </p>

    <p>
      A temporary palm-leaf shed was erected for worship. On July 2, 1912, a Cemetery Chapel
      was built and services were shifted there. The present Church, modeled after St. Paul’s
      Basilica of Rome, was blessed on November 22, 1942.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- NERCHA -->
  <div id="nercha">
    <h2>History of the Kannamaly St. Joseph Nercha Sadya</h2>

    <p>
      The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly is a sacred tradition with a history of
      over 121 years. Its origin dates back to 1905, when Kannamaly faced a devastating cholera
      outbreak.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this period, Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez received a divine vision of St. Joseph with
      Infant Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Inspired by this, the faithful prepared and
      shared blessed food.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, the epidemic subsided completely. Since then,
      Kannamaly has been spared from cholera, and the Nercha Sadya is observed every year on
      March 19.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STATUE -->
  <div id="statue">
    <h2>History of the Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
      The miraculous statue of St. Joseph was brought from Spain by Carmelite priests in 1905.
      When the ship grounded near Kannamaly, one statue was taken ashore and could not be moved
      again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statue was wrapped in straw and forgotten. Later, cattle afflicted with disease were
      healed using straw from the statue, revealing its miraculous power.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statue was repaired and installed in the Church. In 1946, a dedicated chapel was
      built for the statue, which continues to be a source of miracles.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPEL -->
  <div id="chapel">
    <h2>The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
      The original chapel built in 1946 bore the marks of time. The foundation stone for the
      new Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph was laid on March 18, 2012 by Shri Oommen Chandy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Designed with Gothic, Roman, and modern architectural styles, the shrine spans three
      floors and houses relics of ten saints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Shrine was solemnly blessed on March 8, 2015 and stands today as the only shrine in
      Asia enshrining relics of ten saints under one roof.
