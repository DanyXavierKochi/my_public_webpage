    <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

    <p>
      St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 281 years.
      The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church site,
      under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Church was destroyed by sea erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was
      constructed in 1796. In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish
      and declared an independent parish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Severe sea erosions in 1905 and 1908 caused partial damage and complete ruin of the Church.
      On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid at the present site.
    </p>

    <p>
      A temporary palm-leaf shed was erected for worship. On July 2, 1912, a Cemetery Chapel
      was built and services were shifted there. The present Church, modeled after St. Paul’s
      Basilica of Rome, was blessed on November 22, 1942.

      <p>
        The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly is a sacred tradition with a history of
        over 121 years. Its origin dates back to 1905, a time when Kannamaly faced a devastating
        sea erosion followed by a severe outbreak of cholera.
      </p>

      <p>
        The disease, which spread rapidly through contaminated food and water, claimed the lives
        of thousands, leaving the region in deep distress and fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        During this period of suffering, Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez, the then parish priest of
        Kannamaly Church, was blessed with a divine vision in which St. Joseph appeared along
        with the Infant Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by this heavenly revelation, the faithful observed the Feast of St. Joseph on
        March 19, 1905 in a special manner. Food prepared in the homes of the people was brought
        to the Church courtyard, blessed, and shared among the faithful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blessed food was also distributed to those who were sick and unable to come to the
        church.
      </p>

      <p>
        By God’s grace and through the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, a miraculous healing
        followed. The cholera epidemic was brought under control, and the sick were restored to
        health after partaking of the blessed meal.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that day onwards, Kannamaly has been spared from cholera. Since then, every year on
        March 19, the Feast of St. Joseph is solemnly celebrated with the Nercha Sadya.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even today, lakhs of devotees gather at Kannamaly with deep faith to participate in this
        sacred offering and to receive the abundant blessings of St. Joseph.

  <!-- STATUE -->
  <div id="statue">
    <h2>History of the Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
      The miraculous statue of St. Joseph venerated at Kannamaly was brought from Spain by
Carmelite priests through a sea voyage. The priests were transporting three statues of St.
Joseph intended for churches in the southern region of India
    </p>

    <p>
      When the ship reached the western side of Kannamaly, the sail suddenly failed to catch the
wind and the vessel came to a halt. After inspection, it was found that the ship had become
firmly grounded. To reduce the weight, one statue of St. Joseph—whose right leg had
already been damaged during loading in Spain—was taken ashore. Immediately, the ship
floated free. However, repeated attempts to reload the statue were unsuccessful, as it could
not be moved from the ground. Recognizing this as a sign of divine will, the priests
entrusted the statue to the people of Kannamaly and continued their journey.
    </p>

    <p>
    The statue, wrapped in straw, was kept aside with the intention of installing it in the new
Church. In time, it was forgotten. This incident took place a few months after the first
Nercha Sadhya in 1905  
    </p>

    <p>Around the same period, a severe diarroheal illness spread among cattle in the locality,
causing the death of many animals. A woman who came to the church for prayer took a
piece of straw that had wrapped the statue and gave it to her sick cow. The cow recovered
miraculously. Encouraged by this, the straw was given to other affected cattle, and all of
them were healed
    </p>

    <p>Recognizing the miraculous nature of the statue, it was brought out, the broken leg was
repaired, and the statue was reverently installed in the Church. In 1946, during the tenure of
Rev. Fr. Victorinus K.V as parish priest, a Chapel was built, and the statue was installed there.
The same miraculous statue of St. Joseph that arrived in Kannamaly in 1905 continues to
remain here today, blessing all who seek his intercession with faith and devotion</p>

     <p>
      The Chapel originally established in 1946 had borne the marks of time, and the faithful
ardently longed for a new Chapel dedicated to St. Joseph. Accordingly, the foundation stone
for the Miraculous Shrine of St.Joseph was laid on March 18, 2012 by the then Chief
Minister of Kerala, Shri Oommen Chandy, and the foundation stone was blessed by His
Excellency Rt.Rev.Dr.Joseph Kariyil, Bishop of Cochin
    </p>

    <p>
      Incorporating Gothic, Roman, and contemporary architectural styles, the newly constructed
Miraculous Shrine of St.Joseph is artistically designed in the form of a blossoming branch
held in the hands of St. Joseph. Built over three floors with a total area of 5,000 square feet,
the Miraculous Shrine of St.Joseph houses ten smaller Chapels containing the sacred relics
of ten Saints
    </p>

    <p>
      The Miraculous Shrine of St.Joseph was solemnly blessed on March 8, 2015 by His
Excellency Rt.Rev.Dr.Joseph Kariyil, Bishop of Cochin and this Shrine is the only one in Asia
that enshrines the sacred relics of ten saints under one roof
