  <!-- HISTORY -->
  <div id="history">
    <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>
    <p>
      St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 281 years.
      The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church site,
      under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Church was destroyed by sea erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was
      constructed in 1796. In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish
      and declared an independent parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Severe sea erosions in 1905 and 1908 caused partial damage and complete ruin of the Church.
      On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid at the present site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present Church, modeled after St. Paul’s Basilica of Rome, was solemnly blessed on
      November 22, 1942 and is now revered under the patronage of St. Antony.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- NERCHA -->
  <div id="nercha">
    <h2>St. Joseph Feast & Nercha Sadya</h2>
    <p>
      The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly dates back to 1905, during a period
      marked by severe sea erosion and a devastating cholera outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez received a divine vision of St. Joseph with the Infant Jesus and
      Blessed Virgin Mary. Following this, food prepared in homes was blessed and shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, the cholera epidemic was brought under
      control, and Kannamaly has since been spared from the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every year on March 19, lakhs of devotees gather to participate in this sacred offering
      with faith and devotion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STATUE -->
  <div id="statue">
    <h2>Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>
    <p>
      The miraculous statue of St. Joseph was brought from Spain in 1905 by Carmelite priests.
      When the ship carrying the statue reached Kannamaly, it mysteriously grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      One statue was taken ashore, after which the ship floated free. Attempts to reload the
      statue failed, and it was recognized as divine will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miracles soon followed, including the healing of cattle using straw that had wrapped
      the statue. The statue was later repaired and installed in the Church.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPEL -->
  <div id="chapel">
    <h2>Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>
    <p>
      The foundation stone for the Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph was laid on March 18, 2012.
      The shrine combines Gothic, Roman, and contemporary architectural styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built over three floors, the shrine houses relics of ten saints and was solemnly blessed
      on March 8, 2015. It is the only shrine in Asia to enshrine ten saints under one roof.
