<!-- HISTORY -->
<div id="history">
  <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church</h2>

  <p>
    The history of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly dates back to 1745 when the first church was
    constructed under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to severe sea erosion, the church was destroyed in 1795, leading to the construction
    of a second church in 1796. In 1873, Kannamaly became an independent parish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Further sea erosion in 1905 and 1908 caused complete destruction. The foundation stone
    for the present church was laid on June 13, 1909.
  </p>

  <p>
    The present church, modeled after St. Paul’s Basilica of Rome, was solemnly blessed on
    November 22, 1942.
  </p>

<!-- NERCHA -->
<div id="nercha">
  <h2>History of the Kannamaly St. Joseph Nercha Sadya</h2>

  <p>
    The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph originated in 1905 during a severe cholera epidemic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez received a divine vision of St. Joseph with Infant Jesus and the
    Blessed Virgin Mary.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the blessed meal was shared, the epidemic subsided completely. Since then, the
    feast is observed annually on March 19.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- STATUE -->
<div id="statue">
  <h2>Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>

  <p>
    The miraculous statue of St. Joseph was brought from Spain by Carmelite priests in 1905.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the ship grounded near Kannamaly, one statue was taken ashore and could not be moved
    again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, cattle afflicted by disease were healed using straw from the statue, revealing its
    miraculous power.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- CHAPEL -->
<div id="chapel">
  <h2>The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>

  <p>
    The original chapel built in 1946 bore the marks of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundation stone for the new shrine was laid on March 18, 2012.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shrine was blessed on March 8, 2015 and houses relics of ten saints.
