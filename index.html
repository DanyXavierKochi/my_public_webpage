<!-- HISTORY -->
<div id="history">
<h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

<p>St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 281 years.</p>

<p>
The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church site, under
the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. This Church was destroyed by sea
erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was constructed in 1796.
</p>

<p>
In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish and declared as an
independent parish. A severe sea erosion in 1905 caused partial damage to the Church, and
the destructive sea erosion of 1908 led to its complete ruin.
</p>

<p>
On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid by Very Rev. Fr. Antony
Padua, Vicar Forane and Parish Priest of St. Lawrence Church, Edacochin, at the present
location.
</p>

<p>
A temporary palm-leaf shed was erected over the completed foundation, where liturgical
services were conducted. On July 2, 1912, a Cemetery Chapel was built, and the services were
shifted there.
</p>

<p>
The present Church, built following the model of St. Paul’s Basilica of Rome, was solemnly
blessed on November 22, 1942 by His Excellency Dr. Jose Vieira Alvernaz.
</p>

<p>
While the Church was originally dedicated to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception, it is now
known and revered under the patronage of St. Antony.
</p>

<!-- NERCHA -->
<div id="nercha">
<h2>History of the Kannamaly St. Joseph’s Feast and Nercha Sadya</h2>

<p>
The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly is a sacred tradition with a history of
over 121 years. Its origin dates back to 1905, a time when Kannamaly faced a devastating
sea erosion followed by a severe outbreak of cholera.
</p>

<p>
The disease, which spread rapidly through contaminated food and water, claimed the lives
of thousands, leaving the region in deep distress.
</p>

<p>
In this period of suffering, Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez, the then parish priest of Kannamaly
Church, was blessed with a divine vision in which St. Joseph appeared along with the Infant
Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by this heavenly revelation, the faithful observed the Feast of St. Joseph on
March 19, 1905 in a special manner. Food prepared in the homes of the people was brought
to the Church courtyard, blessed, and shared among the faithful.
</p>

<p>
The blessed food was also distributed to those who were sick and unable to come to the
church.
</p>

<p>
By God’s grace and through the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, a miraculous healing
followed. The cholera epidemic was brought under control.
</p>

<p>
From that day onwards, Kannamaly has been spared from cholera. Since then, every year on
March 19, the Feast of St. Joseph is solemnly celebrated with the Nercha Sadya.
</p>

<p>
Even today, lakhs of devotees gather at Kannamaly with deep faith to receive the abundant
blessings of St. Joseph.
</p>

<!-- STATUE -->
<div id="statue">
<h2>History of the Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph of Kannamaly</h2>

<p>
The miraculous statue of St. Joseph venerated at Kannamaly was brought from Spain by Carmelite
priests through a sea voyage. The priests were transporting three statues of St. Joseph intended
for churches in the southern region of India.
</p>

<p>
When the ship reached the western side of Kannamaly, the sail suddenly failed to catch the wind
and the vessel came to a halt. After inspection, it was found that the ship had become firmly
grounded.
</p>

<p>
To reduce the weight, one statue of St. Joseph—whose right leg had already been damaged during
loading in Spain—was taken ashore. Immediately, the ship floated free.
</p>

<p>
However, repeated attempts to reload the statue were unsuccessful, as it could not be moved from
the ground. Recognizing this as a sign of divine will, the priests entrusted the statue to the
people of Kannamaly and continued their journey.
</p>

<p>
The statue, wrapped in straw, was kept aside with the intention of installing it in the new Church.
In time, it was forgotten. This incident took place a few months after the first Nercha Sadhya
in 1905.
</p>

<p>
Around the same period, a severe diarrheal illness spread among cattle in the locality, causing
the death of many animals.
</p>

<p>
A woman who came to the church for prayer took a piece of straw that had wrapped the statue and
gave it to her sick cow. The cow recovered miraculously.
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by this, the straw was given to other affected cattle, and all of them were healed.
</p>

<p>
Recognizing the miraculous nature of the statue, it was brought out, the broken leg was repaired,
and the statue was reverently installed in the Church.
</p>

<p>
In 1946, during the tenure of Rev. Fr. Victorinus K.V as parish priest, a Chapel was built, and
the statue was installed there.
</p>

<p>
The same miraculous statue of St. Joseph that arrived in Kannamaly in 1905 continues to remain
here today, blessing all who seek his intercession with faith and devotion.

<!-- CHAPEL -->

  <h2>The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>

    <!-- RIGHT TEXT -->
    <div>
      <p>
        The Chapel originally established in 1946 had borne the marks of time, and the faithful
        ardently longed for a new Chapel dedicated to St. Joseph.
      </p>

      <p>
        Accordingly, the foundation stone for the Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph was laid on
        March 18, 2012 by the then Chief Minister of Kerala, Shri Oommen Chandy, and the
        foundation stone was blessed by His Excellency Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Kariyil, Bishop of
        Cochin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporating Gothic, Roman, and contemporary architectural styles, the newly constructed
        Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph is artistically designed in the form of a blossoming branch
        held in the hands of St. Joseph.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built over three floors with a total area of 5,000 square feet, the Miraculous Shrine of
        St. Joseph houses ten smaller Chapels containing the sacred relics of ten Saints.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph was solemnly blessed on March 8, 2015 by His
        Excellency Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Kariyil, Bishop of Cochin and this Shrine is the only one in
        Asia that enshrines the sacred relics of ten saints under one roof.
