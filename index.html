  <p>
    St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly is a faith-filled parish with a sacred heritage spanning over
    <strong>281 years</strong>. Rooted in deep devotion and shaped by resilience through centuries
    of trials, the Church stands today as a living testimony of God’s grace and the loving
    intercession of St. Antony.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kannamaly St. Joseph Nercha Sadya, observed annually on <strong>19th March</strong> since
    1905, commemorates a miraculous healing from a devastating cholera outbreak and remains
    a powerful expression of faith and thanksgiving.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph, brought from Spain in 1905, continues to draw lakhs
    of devotees who seek his powerful intercession.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="history">
  <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>
  <p>
    The first church at Kannamaly was established in <strong>1745</strong>, about 3 km west of the
    present site, under the patronage of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. It was destroyed
    by sea erosion in 1795, after which a second church was constructed in 1796.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <strong>1873</strong>, Kannamaly was declared an independent parish. Severe sea erosions in
    1905 and 1908 caused extensive damage and complete ruin of the church.
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundation stone for the present church was laid on <strong>13 June 1909</strong>.
    Built in the model of St. Paul’s Basilica, Rome, it was solemnly blessed on
    <strong>22 November 1942</strong>. Though originally dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate
    Conception, it is now revered under the patronage of <strong>St. Antony</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="nercha">
  <h2>History of St. Joseph Nercha Sadya</h2>
  <p>
    The Nercha Sadya originated in <strong>1905</strong> during a time of devastating sea erosion
    and a deadly cholera epidemic. Rev. Fr. <strong>Joseph Suarez</strong>, the parish priest,
    received a divine vision of St. Joseph with the Infant Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following this, the faithful observed the Feast of St. Joseph by preparing food in their
    homes, blessing it at the church, and sharing it with all—including the sick.
    Miraculously, the cholera outbreak subsided.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then, Kannamaly has remained free from cholera, and the Nercha Sadya continues
    every year on <strong>19th March</strong>.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="statue">
  <h2>Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>
  <p>
    The statue of St. Joseph was brought from Spain by Carmelite priests in 1905.
    When the ship reached Kannamaly, it became mysteriously grounded. One statue—
    with a damaged leg—was unloaded, after which the ship floated free.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attempts to reload the statue failed, and it was accepted as God’s will that the statue
    remain at Kannamaly. Later, miraculous healings occurred when straw from the statue’s
    packing cured sick cattle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recognizing its miraculous nature, the statue was installed in the church and continues
    to bless devotees to this day.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="chapel">
  <h2>Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>
  <p>
    A new shrine was envisioned to replace the old chapel built in 1946. The foundation stone
    was laid on <strong>18 March 2012</strong> by Shri Oommen Chandy and blessed by
    Bishop Dr. Joseph Kariyil.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shrine, built over three floors and artistically designed as a blossoming branch held
    by St. Joseph, houses relics of <strong>ten saints</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Solemnly blessed on <strong>8 March 2015</strong>, it is the <strong>only shrine in Asia</strong>
    enshrining relics of ten saints under one roof.
