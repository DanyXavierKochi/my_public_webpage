  <!-- HISTORY -->
  <div id="tab-history">
    <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

    <p>
      St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over
      281 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church
      site, under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. This Church was
      destroyed by a sea erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was
      constructed in 1796.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish and declared
      as an independent parish. A severe sea erosion in 1905 caused partial damage
      to the Church, and the destructive sea erosion of 1908 led to its complete ruin.
    </p>

    <p>
      On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid by Very
      Rev. Fr. Antony Padua, Vicar Forane and Parish Priest of St. Lawrence Church,
      Edacochin, at the present location.
    </p>

    <p>
      A temporary palm-leaf shed was erected over the completed foundation, where
      liturgical services were conducted. On July 2, 1912, a Cemetery Chapel was
      built, and the services were shifted there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The present Church, which was built following the model of St. Paul’s Basilica
      of Rome, was solemnly blessed on November 22, 1942 by His Excellency
      Dr. Jose Vieira Alvernaz.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the Church was originally dedicated to Our Lady of Immaculate
      Conception, it is now known and revered under the patronage of St. Antony.
    </p>

  <!-- NERCHA -->
  <div id="tab-nercha">
    <h2>History of the Kannamaly St. Joseph’s Feast and Nercha Sadya</h2>

    <p>
      The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly is a sacred tradition with a
      history of over 121 years. Its origin dates back to 1905, a time when Kannamaly
      faced a devastating sea erosion followed by a severe outbreak of cholera.
    </p>

    <p>
      The disease, which spread rapidly through contaminated food and water,
      claimed the lives of thousands, leaving the region in deep distress.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this period of suffering, Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez, the then parish priest of
      Kannamaly Church, was blessed with a divine vision in which St. Joseph appeared
      along with the Infant Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inspired by this heavenly revelation, the faithful observed the Feast of
      St. Joseph on March 19, 1905 in a special manner. Food prepared in the homes of
      the people was brought to the Church courtyard, blessed, and shared among the
      faithful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blessed food was also distributed to those who were sick and unable to
      come to the church.
    </p>

    <p>
      By God’s grace and through the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, a
      miraculous healing followed. The cholera epidemic was brought under control,
      and the sick were restored to health after partaking of the blessed meal.
    </p>

    <p>
      From that day onwards, Kannamaly has been spared from cholera.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, every year on March 19, the Feast of St. Joseph is solemnly
      celebrated with the Nercha Sadya. Even today, lakhs of devotees gather at
      Kannamaly with deep faith.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STATUE -->
  <div id="tab-statue">
    <h2>History of the Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph of Kannamaly</h2>

    <p>
      The miraculous statue of St. Joseph venerated at Kannamaly was brought from
      Spain by Carmelite priests through a sea voyage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The priests were transporting three statues of St. Joseph intended for
      churches in the southern region of India.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the ship reached the western side of Kannamaly, the sail suddenly failed
      to catch the wind and the vessel came to a halt. It was found that the ship had
      become firmly grounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      To reduce the weight, one statue of St. Joseph—whose right leg had already been
      damaged during loading in Spain—was taken ashore. Immediately, the ship floated
      free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Repeated attempts to reload the statue were unsuccessful. Recognizing this as
      a sign of divine will, the priests entrusted the statue to the people of
      Kannamaly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statue, wrapped in straw, was kept aside with the intention of installing
      it in the new Church and was later forgotten.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around the same period, a severe diarrhoeal illness spread among cattle. A
      woman took a piece of straw from the statue and gave it to her sick cow, which
      recovered miraculously.
    </p>

    <p>
      The straw was given to other affected cattle, and all of them were healed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recognizing the miraculous nature of the statue, it was brought out, the
      broken leg was repaired, and it was reverently installed in the Church.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1946, during the tenure of Rev. Fr. Victorinus K.V., a Chapel was built, and
      the statue was installed there.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPEL -->
  <div id="tab-chapel">
    <h2>The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
      The Chapel originally established in 1946 had borne the marks of time, and the
      faithful longed for a new Chapel dedicated to St. Joseph.
    </p>

    <p>
      The foundation stone for the Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph was laid on March
      18, 2012 by the then Chief Minister of Kerala, Shri Oommen Chandy, and was
      blessed by His Excellency Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Kariyil, Bishop of Cochin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Incorporating Gothic, Roman, and contemporary architectural styles, the Shrine
      is artistically designed in the form of a blossoming branch held in the hands
      of St. Joseph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built over three floors with a total area of 5,000 square feet, the Shrine
      houses ten smaller chapels containing the sacred relics of ten saints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph was solemnly blessed on March 8, 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Shrine is the only one in Asia that enshrines the sacred relics of ten
      saints under one roof.
