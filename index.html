  <!-- HISTORY -->
  <div id="history">
    <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

    <p>
      St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 281 years.
      The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church site,
      under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Church was destroyed by sea erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was
      constructed in 1796. In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish
      and declared an independent parish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Severe sea erosions in 1905 and 1908 caused partial damage and complete ruin of the Church.
      On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid at the present site.
    </p>

    <p>
      A temporary palm-leaf shed was erected for worship. On July 2, 1912, a Cemetery Chapel
      was built and services were shifted there. The present Church, modeled after St. Paul’s
      Basilica of Rome, was blessed on November 22, 1942.
    </p>

    <h2>History of the Kannamaly St. Joseph Nercha Sadya</h2>

    <p>
      The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly is a sacred tradition with a history of
      over 121 years. Its origin dates back to 1905.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez received a divine vision of St. Joseph with Infant Jesus and the
      Blessed Virgin Mary.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, the epidemic subsided completely.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- STATUE -->
  <div id="statue">
    <h2>History of the Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
      The miraculous statue of St. Joseph was brought from Spain by Carmelite priests in 1905.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statue was wrapped in straw and forgotten. Later, miracles were revealed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1946, a dedicated chapel was built for the statue.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPEL -->
  <div id="chapel">
    <h2>The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
      The original chapel built in 1946 bore the marks of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The foundation stone for the new shrine was laid on March 18, 2012.
    </p>

    <p>
