<!-- HISTORY -->
<div id="history">
<h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>

<p>St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 281 years.</p>

<p>The first Church was established in 1745, about 3 km west of the present Church site, under the patronage of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. This Church was destroyed by sea erosion in 1795, following which a second Church was constructed in 1796.</p>

<p>In 1873, Kannamaly Church was separated from the Mundamvely parish and declared as an independent parish. A severe sea erosion in 1905 caused partial damage to the Church, and the destructive sea erosion of 1908 led to its complete ruin.</p>

<p>On June 13, 1909, the foundation stone for the third Church was laid by Very Rev. Fr. Antony Padua, Vicar Forane and Parish Priest of St. Lawrence Church, Edacochin, at the present location.</p>

<p>A temporary palm-leaf shed was erected over the completed foundation, where liturgical services were conducted. On July 2, 1912, a Cemetery Chapel was built, and the services were shifted there.</p>

<p>The present Church, built following the model of St. Paul’s Basilica of Rome, was solemnly blessed on November 22, 1942.</p>

<!-- NERCHA -->
<div id="nercha">
<h2>History of the Kannamaly St. Joseph Nercha Sadya</h2>

<p>The Nercha Sadya Feast of St. Joseph at Kannamaly is a sacred tradition with a history of over 121 years. Its origin dates back to 1905, a time when Kannamaly faced a devastating sea erosion followed by a severe outbreak of cholera.</p>

<p>The disease, which spread rapidly through contaminated food and water, claimed the lives of thousands.</p>

<p>Rev. Fr. Joseph Suarez was blessed with a divine vision in which St. Joseph appeared along with the Infant Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>The Feast of St. Joseph was observed on March 19, 1905 with blessed food shared among the faithful.</p>

<p>By God’s grace and through the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, the cholera epidemic was brought under control.</p>

<p>Since then, every year on March 19, the Feast of St. Joseph is celebrated with the Nercha Sadya.</p>
</div>

<!-- STATUE -->
<div id="statue">
<h2>History of the Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>

<p>The miraculous statue of St. Joseph venerated at Kannamaly was brought from Spain by Carmelite priests through a sea voyage. The priests were transporting three statues of St. Joseph intended for churches in the southern region of India.</p>

<p>When the ship reached the western side of Kannamaly, the sail suddenly failed to catch the wind and the vessel came to a halt.</p>

<p>To reduce the weight, one statue of St. Joseph—whose right leg had already been damaged during loading in Spain—was taken ashore. Immediately, the ship floated free.</p>

<p>Repeated attempts to reload the statue were unsuccessful. Recognizing this as a sign of divine will, the priests entrusted the statue to the people of Kannamaly.</p>

<p>The statue, wrapped in straw, was later found to be miraculous, healing sick cattle.</p>

<p>The statue remains in Kannamaly to this day, blessing all who seek his intercession.</p>
</div>

<!-- CHAPEL -->
<div id="chapel">
<h2>The Miraculous Shrine of St. Joseph</h2>

<p>The Chapel originally established in 1946 bore the marks of time, leading to the construction of a new Shrine.</p>

<p>The foundation stone was laid on March 18, 2012 by Shri Oommen Chandy and blessed by Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Kariyil.</p>

<p>The Shrine, built over three floors, houses ten smaller Chapels with sacred relics of ten Saints.</p>

<p>The Miraculous Shrine was blessed on March 8, 2015 and is the only one in Asia enshrining relics of ten saints under one roof.</p>
