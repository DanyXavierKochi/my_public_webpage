  <!-- Church History -->
  <section id="history">
    <h2>History of St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly</h2>
    <p>
      St. Antony’s Church, Kannamaly has a rich and enduring history spanning over 267 years.
      The first Kannamaly church was established in <strong>1745</strong>, about 3 km west of
      the present church site, under the patronage of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.
    </p>

    <p>
      This church was destroyed by a sea attack in 1795, following which a second church was
      constructed in 1796. In <strong>1873</strong>, Kannamaly was separated from the Mundamveli
      parish and declared an independent parish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Severe sea attacks in 1905 and 1908 caused partial and then complete destruction of the
      church. On <strong>13 June 1909</strong>, the foundation stone for the third church was laid
      at the present location. The present church was solemnly blessed on
      <strong>22 November 1942</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though originally dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the church is now
      lovingly known and revered under the patronage of <strong>St. Antony</strong>.
    </p>

  <!-- Nercha Sadya -->
  <section id="nercha">
    <h2>History of St. Joseph Nercha Sadya</h2>
    <p>
      The Votive Feast (Nercha Sadya) of St. Joseph at Kannamaly has a sacred history of over
      <strong>121 years</strong>. It originated in 1905 during a devastating period of sea erosion
      and a deadly cholera outbreak.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inspired by a divine vision received by the parish priest, Fr. Joseph Swares, the faithful
      observed the Feast of St. Joseph on 19 March 1905 with special devotion. Blessed food was
      shared among the people and the sick.
    </p>

    <p>
      By God’s grace and the powerful intercession of St. Joseph, the cholera epidemic subsided,
      and Kannamaly has since been spared from the disease. Even today, lakhs of devotees gather
      every year to participate in the Nercha Sadya.
    </p>

  <!-- Miraculous Statue -->
  <section id="statue">
    <h2>Miraculous Statue of St. Joseph</h2>
    <p>
      The miraculous statue of St. Joseph was brought from Spain by Carmelite priests in 1905.
      When the ship reached Kannamaly, it mysteriously halted until one statue was taken ashore,
      revealing divine intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statue, initially forgotten, later became a source of miraculous healing when straw
      from its wrapping cured diseased cattle. Recognizing its sacred nature, the statue was
      restored and installed in the church.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same miraculous statue continues to bless devotees who seek St. Joseph’s intercession
      with faith.
    </p>

  <!-- New Chapel -->
  <section id="chapel">
    <h2>The New Chapel of St. Joseph</h2>
    <p>
      The foundation stone for the new chapel was laid on <strong>19 March 2012</strong> by
      Shri Oommen Chandy and blessed by His Grace Dr. Joseph Kariyil, Bishop of Kochi.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built in Gothic, Roman, and contemporary styles, the chapel resembles a blossoming branch
      held by St. Joseph. Spread over three floors with 5,000 sq. ft., it houses relics of
      ten saints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blessed in March 2015, this is the <strong>only chapel in Asia</strong> that enshrines the
      relics of ten saints under one roof.
